MY FIRST PROJECT    

Description: This homework had me recreate a webpage from scratch to add to my portfolio. I was to recreate it by using HTML and CSS.
I was to also use my newfound knowledge on flexbox to help. I created classes in css and applied it to my html file. I added a framework in my html and worked on it to get the results I wanted.
